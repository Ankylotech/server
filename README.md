# A Competition to create the best AIs at different games

### Goals

The goal of this program is to allow the hosting of a Programming-competition with different games and multiple AIs. 
The AIs should be allowed to run in as many different Programming-languages as possible, among them has to be Python to 
allow people with minimum experience in programming as possible to participate.

To achieve this the tournament is hosted on a server and communicates with the clients using UDP messages. 

It would be nice if the competition allows for the participants to compete in multiple different games at once and if
the architecture allows for local and fast testing of your own AIs against themselves in many matches or others to 
comprehensively test them.
